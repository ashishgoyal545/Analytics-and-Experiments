# ðŸ“Š Analytics & Experiments

Utilities and templates for **funnels, churn, and A/B tests**.  
These are **PM-friendly tools** to reason about metrics, experiment design, and data-driven decisions.

## ðŸ“Š Example Funnel Visualization
![Funnel Chart](./assets/funnel_chart.png)

| Step             | Users | Drop-off |
|------------------|-------|----------|
| Landing Page     | 1,000 | -        |
| Signup Started   |   600 | 40%      |
| Signup Completed |   400 | 33%      |
| Activated        |   250 | 38%      |

âž¡ Funnel conversion = **25%** (Landing â†’ Activated).

## ðŸ“ˆ A/B Test Significance Curve
![A/B Test Significance](./assets/ab_test_significance.png)

**Interpretation:**  
- Baseline = 10% conversion rate.  
- As the variantâ€™s conversion rate diverges (e.g., 12% or 14%), statistical power rises.  
- Helps decide required sample size before launch.

## ðŸš€ Why This Repo
As a Product Manager, I use these tools to:
- Validate whether **experiments are statistically sound**.  
- Identify **funnel bottlenecks** and prioritize fixes.  
- Make **data-driven roadmap decisions** instead of gut-feel.

ðŸ“Œ *These are simplified, portfolio-friendly versions of the tools I use for product analytics and growth experiments.*
